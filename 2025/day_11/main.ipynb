    "For this, we are given a few nodes and the connections to other nodes (edges). First consideration was using BFS. However, this causes combinational explosion since there are many paths to explore. Instead, we can use DFS with memoization (caching) to store the number of paths from each node to the end. This way, we only compute the number of paths from each node once. This is a lot less useful than using it with BFS since we want to be able to re-use the computed paths from nodes deeper in the graph. BFS would not allow this since we explore layer by layer."
